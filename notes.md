## intro 

I'm Tad Dallas, assistant professor in biology. I test ecological theory using existing data and laboratory microcosms. My focus is on open and reproducible research. Version control helps me do this. 

## What is git used for? 
So git is a version control language. Version control is the ability of seeing multiple versions of the same file, without the sort of nonsense that is depicted in the left cartoon, where you rename a file with the version number appended on to the filename. Version control allows you to switch to old versions, and to see the progress of a project through time. This level of transparency is a cornerstone of open science practices to me. 


## Github 
But git only allows you to version your files locally. So online platforms that host your code and data have emerged, allowing collaborative coding and project development. One such platform is GitHub. In this talk, I will argue that having students use git and GitHub can be a useful teaching tool. 

## github in classroom

So git and GitHub are a great way to do science in an open and reproducible manner, but we're at a teaching symposium right now, and I just introduced a bunch of jargon that you are probably thinking 'no shot students outside of a few disciplines would work with this'. I disagree. And even if students aren't interacting directly with git, course materials can still be openly distributed on GitHub. For instance, I host my course websites on GitHub, increasing reach as it is available to anyone interested. All course materials in multiple formats are available, making it nice and ADA compliant. And instead of clicking through the crummy Blackboard interface, I basically replace Blackboard with a free open-source alternative that I trust to be versioned and nice. 



## GitHub classroom

GitHub classroom is a way to use GitHub with a group of students, allowing the creation of template homework assignments and automated tests of student homework. Since version control is all about incremental progress, you get to view student progress over time on a project, allowing personalized feedback at different stages of the project. So I teach largely computational courses, so I use GitHub classroom to assign coding assignments, and GitHub Classroom checks these boxes. For my courses, version control is an important component, and I need to teach it. Github classroom allows me a way to do this. I need to see where students are struggling. By seeing their previous versioned work, I can see what they are getting hung up on without the need for a 'muddiest point' exercise. Finally, automated tests of code can provide students immediate feedback. 


## challenges
So GitHub classroom can address all of these points and more, and I'll break them down point by point, using screenshots of GitHub Classroom interface to provide some context. 

So a nice thing for teachers is that I can see all courses I've taught using GitHub classroom.

For each course, I can see all of my assignments that students complete. These assignments are set up as private folders, where only me and the student have access. 

Information on assignment deadlines and assignment structure, etc. are all clearly spelled out.

I can see individual student progress as they work on assignments, not only allowing me to see their competence using git, but also what parts of the assignment are sticking points. 

I can write tests that automatically run each time they update the GitHub folder, allowing students instant feedback on their assignment. 

I can see where students are confused. Here, a student wrote in bold "We have not done Poisson distributions yet". I mentioned them briefly during class, but this is a signal that perhaps I should go back and spend a bit more time there in the next lecture. 


## no limits 

This approach is not limited to coding courses though, as students do not necessarily need to use git to get the benefits of GitHub classroom, as they can simply enter text into GitHub directly, allowing all the benefits of automated testing and versioning without the necessity of teaching proper version control. 

Not limited to this semester. Courses change each time you teach them, and GitHub allows me the ability to update course notes, revert to previous versions, etc. easily. 

Finally, by maintaining my teaching materials on GitHub classroom and course website hosted by GitHub, I can expand the potential reach of my material beyond U of SC. 


## course website 

I recognize this was a short talk and I hope that I've at least made someone interested in the utility of GitHub and GitHub classroom to enhance student learning and to keep everything nice, open, and organized. If you're interested in seeing how I put this into practice, feel free to check out the course website. The files are available at that link, and the website is hosted at the link below.

## Thank you

Thank you for your time, and thanks to U of SC and the National Science Foundation for funding. I invite you to explore GitHub and GitHub classroom, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions about any of it. I'm happy to help. For the sake of open science, this presentatation is available on GitHub, and is hosted online at the link on the bottom.
