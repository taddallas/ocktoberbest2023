**Date**: October 6, 2023


This repo contains all the materials for my lightning (10 minute) talk in the `educational technology` section of the Ocktoberbest teaching symposium at University of South Carolina. The goal of the talk is to showcase the use of GitHub Classroom, focusing on the high-level benefits and using my previous experiences teaching [theoretical ecology](https://theoretical-ecology.github.io/), [`reproducible research in R`](https://bioldatascience.github.io/) and [`ecoinformatics`](https://ecoinformatix.github.io/).
